# logfire sources

The Logfire CLI provides an interactive command to manage your sources. With the `sources` command, you can create, list, delete, and update sources for a team.

## Usage

### 1. Interactive

To access the interactive interface, type `logfire sources` in your terminal:

```terminal
logfire sources
```

The CLI will provide you with the following options to choose from:

- `Create source`: Create a new source for a team
- `List sources`: Get a list of all your sources for a team
- `Delete source`: Remove a specific source from a team
- `Update source`: Modify the details of a specific source for a team

Select the option that fits your needs by moving the arrow keys and hitting enter. The CLI will guide you through the rest of the process based on your selection.

### 2. Direct-interactive OR Non-interactive

If you prefer a Direct-interactive OR Non-interactive approach, you can check the following:

- [Create a source](/cli/sources/create)

- [List all sources for a team](/cli/sources/list)

- [Delete a source from a team](/cli/sources/delete)

- [Update a source for a team](/cli/sources/update)
