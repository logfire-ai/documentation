# logfire teams create

The Logfire CLI `logfire teams create` command allows you to create a new team.

## Usage

### 1. Interactive

In the interactive mode, the CLI will guide you through the process. It will prompt you to enter the team name:

```terminal
logfire teams create
```

### 2. Non-interactive

If you prefer a non-interactive approach, you can specify the team name directly in the command using the `--name` option:

```terminal
logfire teams create --name "your team name"
```

Please replace `"your team name"` with the actual name you want to give to the team.
