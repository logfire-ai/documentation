# logfire teams

The Logfire CLI provides an interactive command to manage your teams. With the `teams` command, you can create, list, delete, and update teams, invite members, list team members, remove a member, and update a member.

## Usage

### 1. Interactive

To access the interactive interface, type `logfire teams` in your terminal:

```terminal
logfire teams
```

The CLI will provide you with the following options to choose from:

- `Create team`: Create a new team
- `List teams`: Get a list of all your teams
- `Delete team`: Remove a specific team
- `Update team`: Modify the details of a specific team
- `Invite members`: Add new members to a team
- `List members`: Get a list of all members in a specific team
- `Remove member`: Remove a specific member from a team
- `Update member`: Modify the details of a specific member in a team

Select the option that fits your needs by moving the arrow keys and hitting enter. The CLI will guide you through the rest of the process based on your selection.

### 2. Direct-interactive OR Non-interactive

If you prefer a Direct-interactive OR Non-interactive approach, you can check the following:

- [Create team](/cli/teams/create)
