# logfire alerts

The Logfire CLI provides an interactive command to manage your alerts. With the `alerts` command, you can create, list, delete, pause, and update alerts.

## Usage

### 1. Interactive

To access the interactive interface, type `logfire alerts` in your terminal:

```terminal
logfire alerts
```

The CLI will provide you with the following options to choose from:

- `Create`: Create a new alert
- `List`: Get a list of all your alerts
- `Delete`: Remove specific alerts
- `Pause`: Pause specific alerts
- `Update`: Modify the details of a specific alert

Select the option that fits your needs by moving the arrow keys and hitting enter. The CLI will guide you through the rest of the process based on your selection.

### 2. Direct-interactive OR Non-interactive

If you prefer a Direct-interactive OR Non-interactive approach, you can check the following:

- [Create alert](/cli/alerts/create)

- [List all alerts](/cli/alerts/list)

- [Delete an alert](/cli/alerts/delete)

- [Pause an alert](/cli/alerts/pause)

- [Update an alert](/cli/alerts/update)

Use these commands to directly execute the corresponding actions with command-line arguments.
