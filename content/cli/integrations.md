# logfire integrations

The Logfire CLI provides an interactive command to manage your integrations. With the `integrations` command, you can create, list, delete, and update integrations.

## Usage

### 1. Interactive

To access the interactive interface, type `logfire integrations` in your terminal:

```terminal
logfire integrations
```

The CLI will provide you with the following options to choose from:

- `Create`: Create a new integration
- `List`: Get a list of all your integrations
- `Delete`: Remove a specific integration
- `Update`: Modify the details of a specific integration

Select the option that fits your needs by moving the arrow keys and hitting enter. The CLI will guide you through the rest of the process based on your selection.

### 2. Direct-interactive OR Non-interactive

If you prefer a Direct-interactive OR Non-interactive approach, you can check the following:

- [Create integration](/cli/integrations/create)

- [List all integrations](/cli/integrations/list)

- [Delete an integration](/cli/integrations/delete)

- [Update an integration](/cli/integrations/update)
