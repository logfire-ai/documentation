# logfire views

The Logfire CLI provides an interactive command to manage your views. With the `views` command, you can list and delete views.

## Usage

### 1. Interactive

To access the interactive interface, type `logfire views` in your terminal:

```terminal
logfire views
```

The CLI will provide you with the following options to choose from:

- `List`: Get a list of all your views
- `Delete`: Remove a specific view

Select the option that fits your needs by moving the arrow keys and hitting enter. The CLI will guide you through the rest of the process based on your selection.

### 2. Direct-interactive OR Non-interactive

If you prefer a Direct-interactive OR Non-interactive approach, you can check the following:

- [List all views](/cli/views/list)

- [Delete a view](/cli/views/delete)
