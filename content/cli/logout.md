# logfire logout

The Logfire CLI provides a straightforward command to sign out from your current session.

## Usage

To sign out, simply enter `logfire logout` in your terminal:

```terminal
logfire logout
```

After executing this command, you will be logged out of your session. If you want to interact with Logfire services again, you'll need to log in using the `logfire login` command.
