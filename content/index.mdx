LogfireAI enables you to get all your logs from a variety of sources and platforms all in one place. You can then run queries across all these logs, in realtime. You can dice and slice them in a number of ways. In fact you can write sql queries against the stored logs, that can be used to generate visualizations about what's happening in your dev infrastructure.

# Navigating our documentation
The easiest way to get started with using LogfireAI is to use our command line tool. We've set up a bootstrap flag in this tool to help you set up all your important configuration settings and verify that you are able to send and receive logs on our platform. The [quick start guide](/quick-start-guide) helps you do just that.
